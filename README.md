# telegram_bash
A simple Script in BASH to send messages to Telegram.

I created this simple bash script to send messages to Telegram using a BOT.

Its use is quite simple, only the token and the chat ID are required.

To send the message, just run:

 ./sender.sh "This is the message that will be sent."

And that's it.
